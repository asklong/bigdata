1.  This suggests the following procedure for finding the k means:

    Make initial guesses for the means m1, m2, ..., mk
    Until there are no changes in any mean
        Use the estimated means to classify the samples into clusters
        For i from 1 to k
            Replace mi with the mean of all of the samples for cluster i
        end_for
    end_until
