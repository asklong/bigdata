CF.
we get the item and the users who bought the item.
(item, (use1,user2,user3...))
we computer the item similitary from item1 and item2, by the users of item1 and item2.

for item1, we could recommond item2, item3 by the high possibility of the items.

we have only about 300 items. so we could cluster the uses by the items they bought.
to make the user less. so item will have less users in the same cluster.
to get the simailitary by the users in the same cluster.
