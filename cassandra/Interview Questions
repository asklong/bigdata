1.what is consistency?
Consistency refers to the up-to-date and synchronized data rows on all their replicas.一致性指一行数据的所有replica是否最新和同步。
2.How does Cassandra write?
    Logging data in the commit log
    Writing data to the memtable
    Flushing data from the memtable
    Storing data on disk in SSTables
3.Define memtable.
Similar to table, memtable is in-memory cache space consisting of content in key and column format. 
The data in memtable is sorted by key, and each ColumnFamily consist of a distinct memtable that retrieves column data via key. 
It stores the writes until it is full, and then flushed out.
4.SSTable
SSTable:Sorted String Table, which refers to an important data file in Cassandra and accepts regular written memtables. 
They are stored on disk and exist for each Cassandra table.

5. Explain CAP Theorem.
CAP Theorem plays a major role in maintaining the scaling strategy.
Consistency Availability and Partition tolerance (CAP) theorem states that in distributed systems like Cassandra, 
users can enjoy only two out of these three characteristics.One of them needs to be sacrificed. 
Consistency guarantees the return of most recent write for the client,
Availability returns a rational response within minimum time and 
in Partition Tolerance, the system will continue its operations when network partitions occur.
The two options available are AP and CP.
